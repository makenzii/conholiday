       <h2>Christmas Greenery</h2>
    
       <em>There are many plants used with decoratin during the Christmas season. Some are just plants that are in season during winter, but many have a symbolic meaning that represent much mroe than just the season of Winter.</em>
           
      
        <h3>Holly</h3>
           <p>Holly is seen as a symbolic plant that reminds people of the crown of thorns that Christ was forced to wear as he was nailed to the cross. The pointy sharp leaves resemble the crown and the red berries symbolize his blood. Holly is in season during the winter so it can be a beautiful and abundant plant to have in the home as decoration with strong meaning and beautiful color. It is also called the Christ Thorn.</p>
        <h3>Ivy</h3>
           <p>Ivy is a climbing and clinging plant. it can remind people that they also must cling to God and make Him their support as they make their way to Him. Usually this plant is kept outside and not an indoor decoration but as you pass by it in the winter months you can think of the same symbolism and its relation to God.</p>
        <h3>Mistletoe</h3>
           <p>Mistle toe is actually a mossy, parasitic type of plant that grows on other plants and trees. It shows up during the winter and produces white berries. It was brought indoors as decoration to symbolize symbitoic relationships, ones where both recipients give to eachother. The tradition goes that when two people meet under the mistletoe, one must pick a berry and ask the other for a kiss. When all the berries are gone, no more kissing!</p>
        <h3>Wreaths</h3>
           <p>The word 'Wreath' comes from an old English word, <em>writhen</em>, which means to writhe or twist. Wreaths are a few bunches of greenery twisted and tied into a circle. Circular garlands like wreaths were fashioned and made by the Ancient Greeks as a sign of victory or as a posh headress accessory. Today, many people love to hang wreaths for many occassions on their doors but most popularly at Christmas. Some say that the circular shape of the wreath symbolizes eternity and Jesus' love for all people being unending. They are also beautiful, festive decor that has become a tradition to hang on the front door!</p>
        <h3>Rosemary</h3>
           <p>This fragrance herb was thought to be a favorite of the virgin mother Mary. It has come to be associated with ehr and the remembrance of Jesus Christ. If you do not want to decorate with rosemary, it is a wonderful flavor additive in many dishes, like potatoes and some soups, that can be served at Christmas dinner.</p>
