       <h2>The Christmas Tree</h2>
       <p>Evergreen fir trees have been used in celebrating winter festivals since almost the beginning of time. Trees would be paraded around and branches
           would be used to decorate homes during winter. People have been known to bring trees and plants indoors during winter for them to last the season
           as well as bring life and remind them of spring as it is on its way while winter progresses.
           The Evergreen fir has also been seen as a symbol of the Garden of Eden and used as advertisement for a play about the story of Adam and Eve.
           According to WhyChristmas.com, "In early church calendars of saints, 24th December was Adam and Eve's day. The Paradise Tree represented the 
           Garden of Eden. It was often paraded around the town before the play started, as a way of advertising the play. The plays told Bible stories to
           people who could not read."
           The first true Evergreen being used for Christmas celebration was recorded between 1441 and 1510. The countries of Estonia and Latvia rival for who was first to put up the now beloved Christmas tree. but it was probably Martin luther in the 16th century who brought the fir tree indoors for the holiday. The cleric said that the tree in the moonlight surrounded by stars reminded him of Jesus. Over the years, the fir tree has come to be associated with Jesus through many stories and legends.
           As Christmas trees made their way indoors during the winter, people became mroe creative in decorating. People would create ornaments to memorialize baby Jesus and place those on their tree. Once Royals started to have trees in their home, decoration went above and beyond including candles, frills, and tree skirts. 
           Today we have all styles of decorated trees during the holiday. Real trees, fake trees, pre-lit trees, 13 foot trees, mini trees, theres 
           something for everyone! It wouldnt be Christmas without a tree in the home. Today we still decorate the tree symbolically. The star represents 
           the star that appeared when Jesus was born as a sign of his arrival. Some people put an angel at the top of the tree and that can represent the 
           multiple angels that came to Mary, Joseph, the shepherds, and the wise men in relation to the birth of Jesus. Many people associate the green
           color of the Evergreen with new life, good luck, and the Garden of Eden. The red is associated with the blood of Christ when he died on the 
           cross.
           In a way, the Christmas tree started out as a pagan tradition but slowly made its way into the Christian heart and home, and now everyones home,
           as we celebrate the birth of the Savior Jesus Christ. Putting up the tree marks the beginning of a special season where Christians everywhere 
           take time to think about and worship one of their most important figures. Families come together to cut down trees and decorate them. The 
           Evergreen fir has turned into a memorable tree bringing the human race together each year over and over.
