        <h2>The Story of Christmas</h2>
        <p>
        Christmas nowadays is a wonderful time of year full of red and green and tinsel, but it was not always so. The reason Christmas is traditionally
            celebrated comes from a time long ago in Bethlehem where Jesus Christ was born. Christmas is the day we remember and celebrate the birth of Jesus, the Son of God.
            
        The story of Jesus' humble birth begins with his mother Mary. An angel sent from God came to mary one day and told her she had found favor with God
            and would carry and bear the Savior of the world. She was astounded but accepted such a great task. Mary was engaged to a man named Joseph at
            the time. An angel visited Joseph too, and told him it would be good for him to be married to Mary and that she did indeed carry the Son of God
            in her womb. Mary and Joseph prepared for the birth of Jesus over the months. Mary had a cousin who also miraculously conceived in her old age 
            and they met together and rejoiced. One day there was an announcement made that everyone was to be counted in a census. Mary and Joseph had to
            go to Bethlehem in order to be accounted for. Mary was very far along in her pregnancy with baby Jesus but she went on the journey anyway, with
            the support of Joseph. When they finally got to Bethlehem, they needed a place to stay. Joseph checked every inn so that he and mary could stay
            the night but there was no room anywhere. They finally found a stable where animals were kept. It came time for baby Jesus to make his entry 
            into the world. Mary labored and gave birth to Jesus in a humble stable where goats and sheep fed on straw and huddled together. The Savior of
            the World lay in a manger full of hay beside his mother. 
            
        Many people had heard prophesies of how the Son of God would come into the world. Signs and wonders would mark his arrival on earth. True to 
            prophesy, a new star shone in the night sky as soon as Jesus entered the world. Wise men followed the star to find Jesus and they brought him
            gifts and worshipped him. That night an angel came to shepherds who were watching their flocks in the fields and told them of the great event
            and they too came to see the new baby Jesus. Prophesy had been fulfilled and hopes had been met, and soon many people would be recipients of the
            Lords grace and charity as he would walk the earth giving love, service, and salvation to those who would receive it. 
            
        Mary and Joseph raised Jesus with love and revere, but not without trial. Jesus' popularity had grown since his birth and Herod, a local leader of
            the Romans, did not like that others were talking about Jesus more than him. He saw him as a threat and sent soldiers to kill him. An angel 
            appeared to Joseph in the middle of the night and told him to take his family and flee to Egypt. They did just that and escaped the wrath of 
            Herod. This would not be the last time men and leaders would despise Jesus but depsite that, Jesus continued to preach and heal everywhere he 
            went. 
        To many, Jesus is considered the greatest example of selflessness and love. He is the reason for the season and the reason for so much
            more in our lives as Christians. We must always remember the true meaning of Christmas and how we owe our all to Jesus Christ. This is the 
            story of Christmas.
